INTERNATIONAL PASSPORT: PYTHON PROGRAMMING  
CLASSNOTES & HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT
CLASS - August 6, 2023 - SUNDAY - CLASS 13 @6:45 PM EST (INTERMEDIATE)

CLASSES AND OBJECTS
⁃	Python is an objected oriented programming language.
⁃	Everything in python is an object. Using python, we can create classes and objects.
⁃	In python we can use several different data such as strings, numbers, lists etc.
⁃	With classes and objects, we can create our own data types for anything we want in python.
⁃	Therefore, you could create a computer data type and it could represent a computer and store information.

WHAT IS A CLASS?
⁃	A class is a code template or blueprint for creating objects in python. 
⁃	With a class you can define your own data type.
⁃	We can think of the class as a sketch (prototype) of a computer. 

WHAT IS AN OBJECT?
1.	An object is called an instance of a class. For example, suppose computer is a class then we can create objects like computer1, computer2, computer 3, etc.

# LAB 1 - CREATING OUR FIRST CLASSES AND OBJECTS IN PYTHON

class Computer:

    def __init__(self, screen, motherboard, mouse, headset, brand_is_dell):
        self.screen = screen
        self.motherboard = motherboard
        self.mouse = mouse
        self.headset = headset
        self.brand_is_dell = brand_is_dell


computer1 = Computer("Samsung", "ASRock", "Logitech", "LG", False)
computer2 = Computer("LG", "Apple", "Microsoft", "Alienware", True)

print(computer2.motherboard)

Note: if you get this error (TypeError: Computer() takes no arguments), it’s because you didn’t include two underscore spaces in the init function “__init__”

# LAB 2 - ADDING A FUNCTION TO OUR CLASS IN PYTHON

class Computer:

    def __init__(self, screen, motherboard, mouse, headset, brand_is_dell, mouseduration):
        self.screen = screen
        self.motherboard = motherboard
        self.mouse = mouse
        self.headset = headset
        self.brand_is_dell = brand_is_dell
        self.mouseduration = mouseduration

    def newbuilt(self):
        if self.mouseduration <= 2:
            return True
        else:
            return False
        
computer1 = Computer("Samsung", "ASRock", "Logitech", "LG", False, 1)

print(computer1.newbuilt())
