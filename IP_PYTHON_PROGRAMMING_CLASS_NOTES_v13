INTERNATIONAL PASSPORT: PYTHON PROGRAMMING  
CLASSNOTES & HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT
CLASS - July 23, 2023 - SUNDAY - CLASS 13 @6:30 PM EST (INTERMEDIATE)

READING FILES 
⁃	It is possible to read from external files using python
⁃	In python there will be times when you have to read from files outside your python file (e.g. a text file or csv file)
⁃	You can use the python read command to allow you to read a file that is stored outside your python file

MODES
⁃	Modes (these are important modes you should know as you’ll be using these the most)
⁃	R (read) - Allow you to read the file instead of modifying or changing it
⁃	W (write) - this means that you change the file, such as writing new information and change existing information 
⁃	A (append) - Allow you to append information onto the end. It opens the file in append mode, and when the file is opened in append mode, the file pointer points to the end of the file.

# LAB 1 - CREATING A TEXT FILE

*******************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
MAC/LINUX USERS ONLY: 
(HOW TO CREATE A NEW FILE IN TERMINAL / EQUIVALENT TO NOTEPAD)

1.	In terminal use this command “PWD” - Print Working Directory
2.	In terminal use this command “LS” - List
3.	In terminal use this command “CD” - Change Directory to ==>> Desktop <<== command: cd desktop
4.	In terminal use this command “CD” - Change Directory to your Python folder command: cd “my first python folder”
5.	In terminal use this command “LS” within the “my first python folder” command: ls
6.	In terminal use this command “TOUCH” to create a new text file command: touch < filename.txt > (animelist2.txt)
7.	In terminal use this command “ECHO” to add content to the new file < filename.txt > command: echo “Naruto” >> animelist2.txt
8.	In terminal use this command “ECHO” to add content to the new file < filename.txt > command: echo “Bleach” >> animelist2.txt
9.	In terminal use this command “ECHO” to add content to the new file < filename.txt > command: echo “Dragonball Z” >> animelist2.txt
10.	In terminal use this command “ECHO” to add content to the new file < filename.txt > command: echo “Demon Slayer” >> animelist2.txt
11.	In terminal use this command “CAT” to review the changes to the file < filename.txt > command: cat animelist2.txt

NOTE: YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO REVIEW THE NEW TEXT FILE TITLED “ANIMELIST2.TXT” OR WHATEVER YOU NAMED THE FILE. NOW OPEN OF YOUR VISUAL STUDIO CODE AND SELECT THE FILE IN PYTHON

******************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

anime_file = open("animelist.txt", "r")
print(anime_file.readable())

WHEN YOU RUN THE CODE YOU SHOULD SEE A VALUE OF “TRUE” IN THE PYTHON TERMINAL

# LAB 2 - PLAYING WITH A FUNCTION TO SEE IF OUR FILE CAN BE READ

anime_file = open("animelist.txt", "r")
print(anime_file.read())

# LAB 3 - READING THE CONTENTS OF A FILE 

anime_file = open("animelist.txt", "r")
print(anime_file.read())
anime_file.close()

# LAB 4 - READ AN INDIVIDUAL LINE FROM OUR FILE

EXAMPLE 1 - CONDENSED AND MORE EFFICIENT (PROFESSIONAL STANDARD)
anime_file = open("animelist.txt", "r")
print(anime_file.readlines())
anime_file.close()

EXAMPLE 2 - SPECIFIC LINE FROM OUR CODE (TEDIOUS AND INEFFICIENT)
anime_file = open("animelist.txt", "r")
print(anime_file.readline())
print(anime_file.readline())
print(anime_file.readline())
print(anime_file.readline())
anime_file.close()

# LAB 5 - USING THE .READLINES () FUNCTION TO READ A SPECIFIC LINE WE NEED

EXAMPLE 1 - USING DEMON SLAYER
anime_file = open("animelist.txt", "r")
print(anime_file.readlines()[3])
anime_file.close()

EXAMPLE 2 - USING BLEACH
anime_file = open("animelist.txt", "r")
print(anime_file.readlines()[1])
anime_file.close()

# LAB 6 - ADDING TO OUR LIST USING THE (A)PPEND MODE 
(WRITING AND APPENDING TO FILES IN PYTHON)

anime_file = open("animelist.txt", "a")
anime_file.write("\nGundan")
anime_file.close()

# LAB 7 - USE (W)RITE TO OVERWRITE OUR EXISTING FILE

anime_file = open("animelist.txt", "w")
anime_file.write("Michael Jordan")
anime_file.close()

# LAB 8 - USE (W)RITE TO CREATE A NEW FILE

anime_file = open("animelist1.txt", "w")
anime_file.write("Naruto \nBleach")
anime_file.close()
