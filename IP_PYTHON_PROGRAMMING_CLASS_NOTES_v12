INTERNATIONAL PASSPORT: PYTHON PROGRAMMING  
CLASSNOTES & HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT
CLASS - July 16, 2023 - SUNDAY - CLASS 11 @5:30 PM EST (INTERMEDIATE)

TRY EXCEPT
⁃	Try except is sued to catch errors in Python and will allow your program to try out a piece of code and win what was entered was incorrect, try except will account for that and let the user know they entered in the wrong piece of data. 
⁃	It relates to events that were detected during execution that interrupt the flow of the program.

# LAB 1 - A PROGRAM THAT WORKS CORRECTLY 

Number = int(input("Enter A Number to Start the Game: "))
print(Number)

# LAB 2 - A PROGRAM THAT DOES NOT WORK CORRECTLY 

Number = int(input("Enter A Number to Start the Game: "))
print(Number)

# LAB 3 - APPLYING THE TRY EXCEPT PRINCIPLE TO OUR CODE

EXAMPLE (1):
try:
    Number = int(input("Enter A Number to Start the Game: "))
    print(Number)
except:
    print("Invalid Input, You Did Not Enter A Number! Please Try Again!")

EXAMPLE (2):
try:
    Number = int(input("Enter A Number to Start the Game: "))
    print(Number)
except:
    print("Invalid Input, You Did Not Enter A Number! Please Try Again!")
else:
    print("Thanks For Entering Your Number!")

# LAB 4 - ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF TRY EXCEPT TO OUR CODE

try:
    Number = 50/0
    Number = int(input("Enter a Number: "))
    print(Number)
except:
    print("Invalid Input, please try again")

# LAB 5 - USING THE TRY EXCEPT TO ACCOUNT FOR TWO ERRORS IN MY CODE

try:
    Number = int(input("Enter a Number: "))
    print(Number)
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Hey! It is impossible to Divide by Zero!")
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid Input, please try again")
